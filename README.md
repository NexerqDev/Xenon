# Xenon

A C#-based MapleStory (GMS) launcher that allows for convenience and quick account switching.

Can be used as a sort-of replacement for GameLauncher.exe (not patching though).

## Features

* Log in without messing with Nexon Launcher.
* Save account credentials for even quicker account switching.


## Caveats

* Cannot patch the game at the moment (highly doubt this will be implemented, just too much work - go use Nexon Launcher tbh. Xenon really is designed to be used to just quickly switch accounts like last time.)


## Please note

* If you haven't logged in post-Nexon Global Accounts migration maintenance to Nexon Launcher (2017-04-19), please just log in to it to complete migration to their new accounts system.

That being said, I have tried to the best of my ability to make the program as transparent as possible, and this realistically should not happen.

Nexon - if you don't like this software, please contact me via email or Twitter instead of banning me or whatever, and I will happily get it resolved ASAP (take down the repo, whatever).
