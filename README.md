# Xenon

**NOTE: This program is not as actively maintained as it used to be! I am not particularly active on GMS anymore, thus I do not use this program myself regularly anymore. This is not to say it will not still work, however, but rather use it expecting that something may break! If something does break, don't hesitate to submit an issue here on GitHub and I'll be more than happy to try look into it and fix it!**

A C#-based MapleStory (GMS) launcher that allows for convenience and quick account switching.

Can be used as a sort-of replacement for GameLauncher.exe (not patching though).

## Features

* Log in without messing with Nexon Launcher.
* Save account credentials for even quicker account switching.


## Caveats

* Cannot patch the game at the moment (highly doubt this will be implemented, just too much work - go use Nexon Launcher tbh. Xenon really is designed to be used to just quickly switch accounts like last time.)


## Please note

* If you haven't logged in post-Nexon Global Accounts migration maintenance to Nexon Launcher (2017-04-19), please just log in to it to complete migration to their new accounts system.


## Disclaimer

By using this software, you agree that I (Nicholas Tay `<nexerq@gmail.com>`) and/or collborators am not responsible for any damages that may be caused using this software (account banned, computer went on fire, etc.). That being said, I have tried to the best of my ability to make the program as transparent as possible, and this realistically should not happen.

Nexon - if you don't like this software, please contact me via email or Twitter instead of banning me or whatever, and I will happily get it resolved ASAP (take down the repo, whatever).
